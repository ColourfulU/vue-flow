# React Flow in Vue3 = Revue Flow

This repo is still a big construction site with nothing really finished.
Please check out [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) if you like the idea.

### Motivation
Seeing as many libraries exist in the React ecosystem and Vue sadly does not get the same
love and attention, I decided to port the React Flow library to Vue.js.

## Setup
This project uses Vite.

```bash
# start (dev)
$ yarn dev

# build app
$ yarn build

# serve app from dist
$ yarn serve
```
