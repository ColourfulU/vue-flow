This repo is still a big construction site with nothing really finished.
You can check the examples to see what's working and what's not.
Please visit [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) and support them if you like the idea. 
They did most of the heavy lifting by writing the library in the first place.
All I did is bring it to Vue3.

### Motivation
Seeing as many libraries exist in the React ecosystem and Vue sadly does not get the same
love and attention, I decided to port the React Flow library to Vue.js.

## Usage
Check the React Flow docs for usage. It's really the same.

### Vue3
```bash
# install revue flow
$ yarn add @braks/revue-flow

# or
$ npm i --save @braks/revue-flow
```

### Vue2
This doesn't work with Vue2, sorry.

## Development
This project uses Vite for development and Rollup to create a distribution.

```bash
# start (dev)
$ yarn dev

# build app
$ yarn build

# serve app from build
$ yarn serve

# build dist
$ yarn build:dist
```
