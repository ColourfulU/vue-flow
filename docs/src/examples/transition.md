# Transition

Vue Flow allows you to use transitions while zooming and panning around the Viewport.
This example shows you how to use these transitions to animate actions on your graph.

<div class="mt-6">
  <ClientOnly>
    <Suspense>
      <Repl example="transition"></Repl>
    </Suspense>
  </ClientOnly>
</div>
